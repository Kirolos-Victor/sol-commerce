"This was my first cleanse and found it awesome ! I was worried but wasn’t hard at all , and feel great ! 
Thankyou so much 
Can’t wait to do it again ",5,2018-05-20 17:50:45,2192,Level 1 Lighten Up Cleanse,Mel Mackie,melaniemackie76@gmail.com
"What an amazing cleanse with such great guidance! I could only advise to follow the sol cleanse tips and advise before, during and after your cleanse. 
I thoroughly enjoyed my cleanse whilst looking after my 2 kids (1 and 3) without any struggle. The Sol juices are next level amazing and don’t even get me started on the nutmilk or the dahl... YUM!! 
Looking forward to my next cleanse! ",5,2018-09-10 14:33:58,2192,Level 1 Lighten Up Cleanse,Gemma,gemmalau@hotmail.com
"I feel great! I have tried all of the cleanses now and have enjoyed all of the juices thoroughly. I have had life long stomach digestion trouble so I intend on doing a cleanse monthly to keep feeling this good.

"Wonderful for a first timer! Having never done a cleanse before I didn't really know what to expect but was completely impressed with my decision to go with sol cleanse. 
I was surprised at how much I really enjoyed each juice. There was not one that I did not like and I found myself really looking forward to the dahl juice at the end of my day. 
I never really felt hungry and if I did feel a little lacking in energy then the moment I sipped on my next juice I felt instantly revived. 
Exactly as the instructions recommend, I wasn't constantly thinking of what the first thing I could eat was but how I could be more mindful of what food choices I make. 
Being a mum of 2 kids under 5 i often find myself shovelling whatever food I can in whether its the kids scraps or just something packaged that's in the pantry. 
I am making a conscious choice to eliminate the processed items and just be more organised to make the better food choices that will leave me feeling better in the long run. 
It was the kick start I needed - thankyou!",5,2017-08-23 04:22:46,2192,Level 1 Lighten Up Cleanse,Yasmin,

"awesome first cleanse
I absolutely loved the cleanse! I have never done one before and surprisingly found it fairly easy. I loved all of them except the dahl unfortunately. Everyone else in the group loved it though. I was so refreshed and revitalized after it. I am surprized that I actually wanted to continue on with it!",4,2017-06-23 04:25:36,2192,Level 1 Lighten Up Cleanse,Leah,
"Already planning my next Cleanse 
TERRIFIC experience. Day 3 I woke up feeling the best I have in a very long time. 
I found it very easy, and actually struggled to consume all the juices in a day. The Dahl was a great way to end the day and I loved how well my body responded to the Energise. 
Thank you. I will be back for more x",4,2017-06-19 04:29:04,2192,Level 1 Lighten Up Cleanse,Skye,
"Wonderful!
I can not recommend this cleanse enough! It was so easy to follow, all the components were delicious. I felt great post cleanse and fasting also highlighted to me how much unnecessary and incompatible foods I was consuming.

"Tasty and never hungry... go figure. I have busy days running around and had to keep reminding myself to drink again. Never hungry, very tasty cleanse, fully recommend to anyone cleaning for the first time. The Dahl is so delicious I need the recipe!",5,2017-07-10 04:36:39,2192,Level 1 Lighten Up Cleanse,Vici,
Hi guys. I enjoyed the juices and especially the tea. The Dahl was super yummy. I am a pretty healthy individual and therefore I didn't have major changes after the cleanse. I didn't particularly feel any better for it but I lost a couple of kilos that suprisingly I haven't gained back. I find that the amount of juices with the dahl helps to be lighter but still nourishing your body with good nutrients so it's definitely an awesome cleanse to do for someone keen for a cleanse that doesn't leave you starving. Overall I really enjoyed it.,4,2017-05-09 05:01:54,2192,Level 1 Lighten Up Cleanse,Charlotte,
"This cleanse was surprisingly easy!! I finally took the plunge and signed up for a 5 day level one Sol Cleanse and I wasn't disappointed! Each day I noticed my taste buds adjusting (which meant each day the juices tasted even better) and my cravings for sweet foods became a distant memory. The dahl that came with the cleanse was TO DIE FOR! If I could order it on it's own, I would. After the first day or two, I was hardly hungry and the juices and dahl kept me full throughout the day, even during my night shifts. 
Miriam was amazing and helped me sort out a few issues that I was having really fast which made the whole process really easy. I will definitely be incorporating cleansing into my life more often :)",5,2016-11-20 05:03:57,2192,Level 1 Lighten Up Cleanse,Teah,
"10/10 cleanse. Absolutely loved the cleanse, as someone whose recently had a lot of health issues I felt amazing whilst doing this cleanse and had so much energy! The juices were delicious and really filling and so easy for someone whose working full time. 
I found that this cleanse was a great way to kick bad eating habits and I'm finding myself now reaching for fruit for dessert instead of the usual binge of junkfoods. 
I've tried a lot of cleanses and diets and never made it past the 3 day mark but actually wished to continue the cleanse even afterwards! 
I will definitely be ordering again!",5,2015-11-30 05:06:06,2192,Level 1 Lighten Up Cleanse,Maddy,

"Overall the cleanse was a great experience for my husband and I. The first day was rough, especially the headaches from coffee withdrawals. The second and third days were good. The lentil soup was our savour at night, and we both woke up not hungry.  Have recommended the others already and will do cleanse in the future again.

"I just completed a 5 day Level 1 cleanse. I didn't consider myself as 'unhealthy' but I was finding I was craving a caffeine hit twice a day, reaching for a sugary snack for that 'hit' and just too much carbs and not enough water. Day 1 was great and I thought ""This is a breeze"", then day 2 hit and the full caffeine/sugar withdrawal hit me big time. I had a dull constant frontal headache, and was irritable and moody. But I stuck with it and beay day 4 this was gone. I did get very sore muscles and found I was craving salt so had some in warm water which combated that. I enjoyed the 'wisdom' heated up each night and it felt like a meal. Also 'peace' was a favourite of mine. All in all I can say that apart from the physical (flatter stomach and weight loss) doing the cleanse has 'cleansed' me of my sugar and coffee addiction. I now am more aware and thoughtful of what I eat and drink. It's a journey of ups and downs but I can truly recommend it for overall health and vitality.",5,2018-05-27 17:49:14,2192,Level 1 Lighten Up Cleanse,Melissa P.,melissapearson1@bigpond.com

"Thank you for helping us 'get back on track' with healthy eating and lifestyle choices. This was also my partner's first juice cleanse ever, and he was a little skeptical at first, but he found the cleanse relatively easy, and he fell in love with the dahl (for a meat eating tradey, this is kind of a big deal lol)  We will try and do this Level 1 cleanse a few times a year for sure x",5,2018-05-14 12:31:39,2192,Level 1 Lighten Up Cleanse,Hannah M.,hannah@goldcoasttipis.com.au

"The juices were delicious and the tea was so nice to drink and the whole experience made me feel so much lighter, clearer and better.

I went into this an open mind and a moderate amount of determination not quite sure what I would get out of it. It turned out to be a positive experience that reset my mind and body to a healthy space. After being super healthy for a season I had let a few bad habits creep back in. This cleanse reset my mind and body and gave me the boost I needed to get back on track. I had a few headaches and day 2 I was lacking my usual energy and had to focus on the goal but by day 3 I felt good and found it perfectly doable. I expect I’ll do it again when I get into unhealthy habits and use this as my reset strategy. Thanks Sol Cleanse ,5,2018-09-29 09:55:31,2192,Level 1 Lighten Up Cleanse,Claire,clairehkelly1@gmail.com

"I have done a juice cleanse in the past but found this one a lot easier to stick with as it all tasted so good. I had one hell of a headache at the end of the second day, but after Christmas and new year it was no surprise I needed rid of some toxins, resting and taking it easy made it easier to deal with. I feel like it was the perfect way to reset my mind with food after the festive season and only seem to be craving healthy whole foods and vegetables since completing the cleanse.

"This was amazing for me. I was so nervous to start a detox cleanse as I felt like after I had my second baby I fell into a rut of 'Grab and go' food, unhealthy, unmotivated and tired all the time. I felt on day two I hit a wall of emotion, however it was the release I needed! I now feel happy, healthy and make better food choices for me and my family. LOVED the Dahl and the green smoothies- I could eat the Dahl for dinner everynight for the rest of the month if I could, it was yummy.

"I loved everything about this cleanse!  I did the three day cleanse, but wished I went for the 5 day, as the Ingredients in the juices and the extra supplements give you the energy and positivity needed to endure the cleanse.  

The packaging is amazing, so much care and thought has gone into it.  Every time I opened a juice, I felt like I was opening a present.  

The juices are delicious.  So fresh, every mouth full is a delight.  Wisdom is such a nice way to end the day.

Now fore the results.  I wasn’t doing it for weight loss, so I didn’t weigh in.  However, my tummy feels smaller, I have more energy and I am not feeling bloated anymore.  My sleep has also improved.  Amazing how 3 short days can make such a big difference.

"I chose to start with the level one cleanse for my first day, to help the transition into cleansing. I work as a chef so I am surrounded by food daily, I knew it was going to be a challenge. I decided a week before my cleanse to stop drinking coffee, which I think really helped the cleansing too. I found on my first two days I was lacking some energy, but after the start of the day and with adequate water intake I could notice my cravings reduced dramatically. I stopped snacking, I could feel when my body was actually hungry or if I was just bored and eating. 
I can’t stress enough how amazing that change feels. I’ve gone from never having an empty stomach to actually letting my body stop, consume, digest, and reset ready for the next meal. 
The juicing cleanse really helped to strip my body back to what I really need from my diet. ",5,2019-08-09 10:55:16,2192,Level 1 Lighten Up Cleanse,Imogen Ewart,iimewart@gmail.com
"This was my second attempt at a cleanse but my first experience with Sol. It was wonderful. Not only were the juices and Dahl incredibly tasty, but I felt nourished and by day two, felt my energy levels improve. I have suffered from a number of serious health issues in recent years, so maintaining good health is critical. By day 4, I really missed not having any jars in my fridge! I felt satiated, and the variety was excellent. I will be back for more, far more regularly. Thanks so much.",5,2019-07-14 18:02:23,2192,Level 1 Lighten Up Cleanse,Juliana,joolzj@gmail.com

"I really enjoyed the cleanse, my first ever. My husband and I did it together and it was easy and enjoyable. The whole process was easy to follow and lovingly presented. Most of the juices were quite nice (some a little more than others!) and the quality was amazing. I didn't experience any significant hunger issues and actually found it very easy to stick to, but my husband struggled a little towards the end of the day in terms of hunger, but he was still able to stick with it. There were two reasons I didn't give 5 stars - I struggled with the mylk (I just couldn't stomach the taste so I didn't drink them at all) and it's a little frustrating that I now have 36 glass jars to get rid of! It would be fabulous if we could return them for re-use (even at an additional cost). However, the benefits far outweigh any negatives. After the cleanse we've noticed we're more aware of what our bodies need, our portion sizes have decreased, our snacks have lessened, we're choosing the healthy options, we're no longer craving sugar or processed foods (my main motivation for this cleanse), we have a sense of control over what we eat, we've had some minor weight loss, and as we've reintroduced certain foods, it's helped us pinpoint any foods that don't agree with our bodies. I would definitely recommend a Sol Cleanse, especially if you've never done one before.",4,2019-07-16 16:32:51,2192,Level 1 Lighten Up Cleanse,Rebecca T.,rebeccacoughlin@gmail.com
"I throughly enjoyed my 3 day cleanse and will certainly be recommending it to my friends and family. I feel refreshed and have found myself eating smaller, healthier meals post cleanse. The first day I experienced some caffeine withdrawals and food cravings but the second day was much easier and I did't feel hungry at all. The extra inclusions of the tea, probiotics, the metal straw and tea strainer were such a nice touch and made me feel prepared for my cleanse. Delivery was also fantastic with the driver leaving my package inside my gate and texting me a photo of where he left it (as I was out).

"I loved doing this cleanse and I would definitely recommend it to anyone.  I was worried I wouldn't make it through but it was actually quite easy because every time I felt a little bit hungry, it was almost time for the next juice or a tea.  
Every juice tasted great, even my young daughters were stealing sips here and there!  I especially loved the Wisdom dahl which I switched from dinner on day 1 to arvo on day 2 and  to lunch on day 3.  At the end of day 3, I still had a juice left over which I had for breakfast the next day.  I felt I could have kept going another day or two!  
It was definitely the kickstart I needed to get me back into healthier habits.  I am thinking a lot more about what I am putting into my body. There is also a noticeable decrease to my tummy, which is always a bonus!

Lighten Up Cleanse is the easiest to help me restart healthy eating and lifestyle. It is well balanced and nourishing. I use it when I need to re-set myself. It helps having the juices on-hand and not having to prepare them...… this works with my busy lifestyle.,5,2019-10-16 18:46:56,2192,Level 1 Lighten Up Cleanse,Philippa Bond,pbond@informtraining.com

"Delicious juices and the information pack and emails that came with it really made the whole experience excellent. You can tell that the team is passionate about wellbeing.
There was only one juice that I didn't love but it was definitely bearable.
I did get a bad headache on day two and a mild one on day three but overall felt light and pretty good. I have young kids so I would recommend parents to make sure they have some support on days one and two, in my case, to take the kids so you can rest when required. 
Overall I am really glad I completed it and so proud that I actually stuck to it as I have never done a cleanse of any type.

"I absolutely loved the lighten up cleanse. I loved the fact that they’re cold pressed and organic which makes you feel instantly healthy. I am a first time detox/juice/ cleanser and was pleasantly surprised as to how delicious the juices were and filling! I loved their step by step instructions, meditation tape and yoga posses which are surprisingly really important during a cleanse. 

On day 1 I found OK and by the end of the day I felt like ordering a burger but I pushed through and tried my last juice of the day which happened to be a lentil soup and it filled me right up, it was also super delicious to my surprise. Day 2 seemed so much easier to not eat but I did have a bit of a headache and going into day three I found a little difficult but with mindful meditation and yoga I felt that it really helped me get through the day. I’m now on day 3 of not being on the cleanse and I have notice re introducing certain foods how they react with my body which I think has been great and I am definitely eating much more clean.

"This was my first ever cleanse and I absolutely feel so amazing and light! I continued working and parenting during this time so there were some challenging times! I felt the first few days were the hardest with a constant head ache and I was really looking forward to that warm Dahl in the evenings for some grounding time.  But by day three & four I was really into a rhythm of listening to my body in what it needed and when.  By day five I only ended up having three elixirs as my body just wanted to have a big rest.  My bloating had reduced and had so much more energy!

"My partner and I are doing our first ever juice cleanse onto day two today and so far we couldn’t be happier with our decision of choosing Sol. 

We have been very impressed with the information provided to prepare us prior to the cleanse,  guide into showing us what we could expect (good and bad), daily emails to help guide us to get the best out of your cleanse. There are such things as mediation, teaching you to listen to your body during the cleanse and post, teaching you the importance of rest. 

It has reset our bad habits we have gained over covid.

"The 3-day cleanse was fantastic--delicious, fresh and so simple. I now feel refreshed, recharged and actually wish I had chosen the 5-day cleanse--something I previously thought I would not be able to do! The 3 days were much easier than I thought it would be (having previously failed at doing more than one day of my own juice cleanse). A colonic helped to keep detox symptoms at bay and amplified the cleanse action. The fresh juices, smoothies and dhal were simply delicious, the supplements and herbal tea were a lovely addition and I never felt hungry. Since finishing, I am more mindful in my snacking and gravitate towards fresh, wholefood.

I’m really glad I weaned off coffee the week prior, so I didn’t have to deal with withdrawal headaches. The juices were delicious, and by the time I started to feel hungry it was time for another. It has really highlighted for me how much I eat and drink when I don’t really need to, it’s just out of habit or boredom. I’m feeling so much happier which has to be all the beautiful nutrients I’ve been nourishing my body with. I will definitely do another cleanse in the future.

"It was only by chance that I came across Sol Cleanse in my google search when I was researching juice cleanse. I have to say that all but one juice (Joy) was thoroughly delicious and I did not struggle with it in the slightest. If anything I felt fuller than usual! I lost close to 2kg, which I was an added bonus as I really chose to do this to help with my bad habit and love of sugar. I am not craving it as much after the three day cleanse and I am delighted with the way I felt lighter and clearer, whilst not being hungry. I must add that I did not like the “Joy“ juice because I cannot eat lettuce as it makes me burp. Other than that, I’m sure others would find it very tasty.

"Absolutely + without hesitation recommend this. It’s been a game changer for my mindset and the kick start I needed to journey back to wellness. 

The juices themselves are all delicious and exceeded my expectations. In particular, the Wisdom soup was wonderful and nourishing when I felt I needed something “more.” The ritual of the tea was a good anchoring tool. And the Peace milk = so delicious. 

The result of the cleanse for me has been a boost of energy, reduced sugar cravings (in fact, all I’ve craved since doing it has been veggies and fruit), clearer skin, better digestion and a 3kg weight loss. Added bonus for me was that it’s not been more than a week since I’ve had coffee (I was drinking 2-3 a day), so this is a big unexpected perk too. 

All in all, wonderful. Recommend especially if you’re looking for a reset or kick start to a healthy way of life. Thanks Sol 💕 ",5,2020-12-05 19:05:02,2192,Level 1 Lighten Up Cleanse,Anonymous,annalee.skehan@gmail.com

"My three day cleanse amazing. I thought I would be starving and feel awful. Apart from a headache late on day 1, I actually felt amazing.  On the second day I had a few hunger pains around 11 so had some psyllium and drank some water and I felt much better.The juices were just such high quality. I thoroughly enjoyed them all even the one with banana (and I HATE) banana.  The Dahl in the evening was a perfect way to finish the day.  I got through without eating anything additional.  Perfect way to start 2021! Thanks so much Sol Cleanse! ",5,2021-01-09 15:46:10,2192,Level 1 Lighten Up Cleanse,Kim Grierson,kimosabe990@gmail.com

I felt absolutely amazing! Full of energy! Even while we had two sick babies at home that didn’t sleep through the night I still was so full of energy. I lost 4kg during the 5 day level 1 cleanse. Even my 10 year old son who doesn’t like vegetables thought some of the juices were pretty yummy.

"I would recommend this cleanse for first-timers. Having the nut milk in the morning was a nice substitute for coffee, the smoothie at lunch helped hunger and the dahl at dinner was delicious.

I had a lot of headaches throughout because I  didn't take the time to detox from coffee before I started so would definitely recommend that. I had to go out for a work lunch on day 2, which was really hard to sit there not eating with everyone else so definitely pick days you won't get into a situation like that!

Once I finished, I actually missed the lovingly prepared and wholesome elixirs - each one was incredibly tasty. This is on the back of a company that has 7 years experience in finessing their practices.  
The entire journey was seamless- from ordering online, to the thoughtfully packaged box arriving, and all the little goodies included along the way.

"Well I am not the greatest clean eater but i also see great benefits from a juice diet. I normally make the juices my self but it makes it very hard to do when your not feeling the greatest while detoxing. Solcleanse make the whole process so much easier and the juice taste good also. 

I felt great after the 3 day process. I am plan on incorporating the 1 day level 3 clean to my training and health program.",5,2017-01-27 10:57:13,2284,Level 2 Refresh Cleanse,Unknown,

Third time & loved it! In my late sixties & my body has been rebelling against a not so perfect diet for a lot of years. I found I felt really great after each cleanse & my system has felt 100% better. Reflux gone - and I kicked the sugar cravings. It's given me incentive to eat much healthier again. I'd recommend it to anyone wanting to improve their health & give their body a rest & refresh. 10 out of 10 from an old girl!,5,2016-11-16 11:03:40,2284,Level 2 Refresh Cleanse,Unknown,

"I chose to do the 3 day cleanse at the beginning of my two week holiday to give my digestive system a rest and replenish from a year of stress and at times, neglect. It was the best thing and really set the tone for a healthy, relaxing, nourishing trip. The first day of the cleanse was hard and I suffered from a coffee withdrawal headache most of the day. This disappeared by the 3rd day but I felt very tired and fatigued day 2 and 3. The email support made me understand that all of this was natural and meant the cleanse was working and my body was releasing toxins. Since finishing the cleanse I feel light, healthy and fresh. I have removed gluten and dairy from my diet and could not feel better. This was the perfect reminder for me to put my health and wellness first, always! Highly recommend this cleanse for anyone.

"I was a bit nervous to start this as I didn't think I could last without any food, I tend to get quite light-headed and start feeling faint when I haven't eaten breaky - my will power also hasn't been as strong lately so thought I was going to give in and just end up eating food. I stuck to the full three days of the cleanse and I feel a lot stronger mentally because of it! The first day was hard - even by 12PM, I had brain fogginess, grumbling tummy and headaches. The 'Strength' juice really helped me in the morning to give me the energy for the rest of the day... I also loved 'peace' as my little dessert in the evening. I lost 2.5kgs - possibly a lot of water weight - but still pretty crazy in just 3 days. More than anything, I feel like I've given my body a proper reset and just feel like eating wholesome healthy food.

The last cleanse I did involved making everything myself and it all tasted terrible! I wasn't able to buy all my ingredients organically and spent hours in the kitchen prepping and making the juices/ smoothies.
Doing a Sol Cleanse 3 day Refresh Cleanse has been an absolute pleasure and taken all the hard work out of it. 
All of the juices taste amazing and I know I am getting organic goodness with every sip. 
I love that they are packaged in glass bottles which I will re-use as pantry/ fridge storage.
The level of support I have received through the dally emails with yoga, meditation and worksheets and the Facebook group has been over and above anything I expected.

I'd love to see Sol incorporate a jar collection for re-use.  We kept all of our jars from the first cleanse and use them for storage, but can't accommodate another 18 jars, and it seemed such a waste to throw them into recycling. We'll continue to use Sol, so would love a solution for repeat customers that reduces our environmental impact.

It was challenging at times but there was always another juice, smoothie or delicious tea waiting for me. I LOVE that they were pre made and ready. I couldn’t have kept it up if I was to juice that much on my own! The variety was amazing. 

What I love is the new habits it’s helped me create moving forward. I’m kicking off my morning rituals (very different to my old ways!), and have become more conscious of what’s going into my body.

Yes I found it hard but once you’re “in” you feel like you’d be letting yourself down to stop.  The  constant updates and encouraging messages from  admin really helped and kept me on track. The juices, although I was skeptical at first from the look of some of them, were actually very tasty and there were 2 that I shall actually miss!!  I’m so beyond happy with the results too. I did this as a kick start to losing weight and boy did it live up to my expectation, however I didn’t realise just how much energy I would regain when I finished. I felt truly cleansed, light and enthusiastic about a new routine and exercise.

"On my part, the cleanse was hard and the detox symptoms were full on. Thankfully Sol had everything preplanned and really to support me during this time. From the delivery, to the little extra things they provide to support you on your journey, to the look and taste of the products, Sol was exceptional. I loved that the Level 2 had two nut milk based smoothies because it supported that time of the day when I felt extra hungry, and the nut milk, chia, and bananas provided that feeling of fullness. You really go on an inward journey on a detox, and the Sol package arrived full of nourishment right from the prep via email, daily email to keep you motivated, and of course the products. three days of detox for me was hard, but I really feel like I was in good hands and supported. i think my next one will be easier :-) Thanks, Sol xx ",5,2020-06-02 11:45:34,2284,Level 2 Refresh Cleanse,Michelle Blanco,cookstaa@hotmail.com

Thoroughly enjoyed all the juices despite having to go to work on 2 of the days. Didn’t have any urge to eat anything else. Am finding that now I’m not as hungry as I used to be And only looking for healthy foods to eat. Bonus is that I have shed 2 of the Extra kilos I put on during COVID.

The drinks are so well thought out and planed to optimise your day and your needs to response to the cleanse. Absolutely delicious and was not hungry.

My 40'th birthday is only days away and I feel as though I'm starting the next decade of my life fresh and ready. I loved all the meditations, yoga, inspiring emails and workbooks. I think this cleanse has been the best I've done, not only because of the amazing, organic and lovingly prepared juices but also my mindset and intentions for doing the cleanse. This isn't my first Sol Cleanse and it won't be my last.

"There are many things to love about this cleanse, here are my top three:

* Having all of the juicing done and delivered to me…such a beautiful nourishing gift to my future self…and no juicer clean up…win win!
* The taste…hard to choose a favourite they were all delicious! The challenge was trying to keep my 5 year old daughter from guzzling them too!
* The support…physically in the form of probiotics and fibre to help keep my gut in the groove and emotionally with daily inspiring love in my inbox.

And a special mention to the Be Light Tea…because every woman needs a daily date with a good cuppa and some self-loving ;)”",5,2015-11-19 11:36:57,2291,Level 3 Deep Clean Cleanse,Jayne Roberts,

"My last cleanse was level 2 and I really loved the nut drink at night. I felt that it really filled me up and kept me going so I was a little apprehensive about going hard core with level 3.

I can now say that it was fantastic and I felt great doing it.. I loved all the juices, felt full all the time and drank everything!",5,2015-07-23 11:39:42,2291,Level 3 Deep Clean Cleanse,Jacklyn Lodge,
"I personally decided to embark on a 5-day Sol Cleanse to honour my body, and only nourish my body with the highest quality of nutrients and minerals. I wanted to completely flush out all the toxins from my body and reset my gut bacteria, whilst strengthening my immune system and in the hope to reduce bloating.

Firstly, I have to say that the range of Sol Cleanse juices are not only incredibly delicious, but also taste so damn fresh, nutrient dense and REAL! So the taste of these juices just made the cleanse all that more easier to enjoy.

Throughout my 5-day cleanse I noticed an increased amount of energy, especially in the mornings, increased focus, concentration and clarity, increased self-confidence and self-belief, decreased bloating (and a flatter stomach) and slight weight loss.

Now I'm not going to lie, during my cleanse temptations did arise and the aromas of some of my favourite foods danced before my two nostrils. I am usually one to crumble and give in to these tasty temptations, however this time I didn't. This time, I had a purpose and had challenged myself in advance to not give in to my indulgences. Whenever I had the slightest craving or temptation, I quickly reminded myself of WHY I was doing this cleanse and in an instant, these temptations were lost.

One of the biggest lessons that I have taken away from this cleanse is that I can do anything and everything that I truly set my mind to. This cleanse has reassured me that I do have an incredibly strong mind and willpower. If I challenge myself and want something so badly, then there isn't going to be any obstacle that can get in my way of reaching it. 

So thank you Sol Cleanse!",5,2015-07-20 11:41:34,2291,Level 3 Deep Clean Cleanse,Stephanie Fallon,
"I really enjoyed the juices from Sol Cleanse! I wasn't hungry during the 3 days bar the first night, going to sleep fixed that and by morning I felt fresh and amazing! No cravings. I went cold turkey off coffee (always had a coffee everyday) and found that the coffee was one major cause of feeling tired, hypo & uneasy. My mindset was way healthier and more calm! And my skin was starting to glow! It was almost like a 3 day journey of changing my relationship with food & becoming more in tuned  with my body! Definitely recommend Sol Cleanse!

"I absolutely loved the Sol Cleanse! I didn't feel hungry at any stage during the 5 days & all of the juices were delicious. After just one day I wasn't bloated, I felt lighter. I had a minor headache on day 2 & 3 but no other negatives. Since the cleanse I feel lighter, cleaner & refreshed. My energy is better, I am sleeping better, my skin looks great, my eyes are bright & best of all I have stopped taking my hormone replacement & have not had any horrible hot flushes! They were out of control prior to the cleanse so this is a major bonus for me! Also I lost a few kilos which feels amazing! I am going to do Sol Cleanse twice a year from now on, I love it!

With a Son and juggling lifes' demands I feel 3 days would be a bit much for me. 1 day is achievable and I absolutely love it! I love the ritual of the cleanse, grateful for the support and kindness, the taste of the juices and tea. The probiotics and psyllium husk I take for the rest of the week. I recommend it to anyone.

"My wife and I did the 5 day detox together and it was really good. I have done the cleanse 3 times before but it was my wife’s first time. We encouraged and supported each other through each day. The first day for my wife was the toughest as she had a terrible headache and for me I woke up in the morning damp from sweating out all of those nasty toxins.It was good to see that the juices were doing their thing. My wife said she feels soo clean and all her bloating has gone and had lost a little bit of weight. I feel soo much better, I have more energy, no brain fog and have lots a few kilos. The only struggle really was because of the cold weather you don’t always feel like cold drinks but thank goodness for the tea.

The juices were delicious and not having to think about or make them (or cleaning up after making them!) made it much easier to stay on track. Especially on the days I struggle on a cleanse (day 3 is always hard for me).
The little schedule helped in this way too.  And the suggested mindful activities were lovely.
I don't normally look forward to a cleanse but this I did.  Getting the box was delivered was like getting a big gift. (It was actually a mother's day gift from my partner).  So it was all a bit special.

"I have completed a 3-day juice cleanse with Sol Cleanse several times over the last few years. I have always had a very positive experience. From an easy delivery service to clean organic juices that leave me feeling amazing. Daily support emails with suggestions for cleansing and rituals including tea to help ease some of the hunger pains (cleansing impacts on the body). My personal favourite is the love beetroot blend. It has really helped kickstart my journey back into clean organic eating! Overall the cost is very pricey and because of this I can only cleanse once or twice per year, but the goodness and overall benefits out ways the price. Thank you so much. Looking forward to cleansing again later in the year!

Thank you for such amazing support and guidance to help me through, I have such a better understanding now of listening to my little body and what it needs .

"I would highly recommend this juice cleanse! I honestly feel amazing after it. I didn't think I would ever have the mental strength in me to do something like this. I came into the cleanse with the intentions of a healthy reset for my body and that is exactly what I've come out of it with. Sol Cleanse has shown me how much strength and commitment I really have if I set my mind to something!! I loved having an increased amount of energy in the morning and was always extra motivated for my day. I must admit that day 2 was the hardest for me, I had no energy and really struggled to concentrate. Mentally I feel like I have become stronger over the last 3 days which is exactly what I needed. My bloating has decreased significantly and I have also lost around 5kgs. I have gained mental strength, self confidence and self belief during this cleanse. The biggest thing I have taken from this is that I really can set a goal and achieve it...

"After finding myself in hotel quarantine (in the smallest room imaginable, being served unhealthy meals) and in the lead-up to Christmas, I thought it would be a good time to try a juice cleanse. Having never done one before I was a little skeptical of the benefits and whilst the first day was hard, by the end of it I felt amazing! The juices were delicious and I felt lighter and re-set ready for the Christmas break.

"Never having done a juice cleanse before I was a little hesitant as I love food, but I really wanted to try it to see what all the fuss was about. On top of this, I was in quarantine and the food being delivered was less than enticing. 
The first day was a challenge but after that I began to really enjoy it. I’d look forward to my juices and really could see the benefits. 
The support during the cleanse was next level from Sol Cleanse, communication was fast and the daily emails were a lovely touch ☺️

"The first day made me realise who much I think about food. It was challenging but I wasn't tempted at anytime. One recommendation I can give is, if you weight train please have the three days off. I'm stubborn so continued with weight training regime which made me feel light headed and very fatigued on day two and three. I did eat something light for dinner on my last two days because I was listening to my body. But overall I felt nourished, lighter and super hydrated. The taste of every juice was amazing.

"What an amazing experience with Sol Cleanse I have had. From when I collected my package and opening to notice the fabulous attention to detail with all the information provided. It was easy to see you really love what you are able to offer and truly believe in the Juice Cleanse.

I came across the information at a Lorna Jane outlet and as I had not been through any type of cleansing process before I reviewed and felt comfortable to give my body the opportunity to eliminate it's stored toxins in a natural way.

I became Redundant from my work after 14 years last month, signed up with TAFE to study Health and Fitness on Day 2 of my Cleanse and can honestly say I feel lighter, brighter and my glow is back.

I am also now looking for a Choc Coconut Vegan Protein Powder like the one used during my cleanse in my day to day activities, it was yummy.

I thoroughly enjoyed my Active 3 Day Cleanse and can really feel the benefits and recommend Sol Cleanse.",5,2017-09-14 11:54:05,2305,Active Cleanse,Sharon,

I wanted to challenge myself while also giving my body a full flush out of all the toxins built up over the years. This cleanse was a challenge but I did compete with no naughties.

"This is the first cleanse I have ever done and given this I made sure I chose the best one to try out! My friend had just completed a similar sol cleanse and really felt great so I thought I'd give this one a try. I chose the active one as I train 5 days a week. On the active cleanse I dropped back on my training and chose to use this time to rejuvenate my body by doing walks and taking in the beautiful surroundings! I really loved the psyllium and probiotics and the be light tea was beautiful. I loved the protein powder and found these great i the morning after my walk and at night around dinner time but by far my most favourite was the 'Peace plus', I looked forward to this at lunch each day and savoured every mouthful ❤️ I loved starting my day with 'Energise' and the 'Love' juice with its amazing colour was a lovely morning tea. I admittedly was not a fan of 'Joy' or 'Radiance' but this is only because I don't like kale, spinach or cucumber in a juice! When I do this again im hoping to swap these for 'Courage' and 'Wisdom'. I felt amazing after the 3 days and can't wait to do this again. Thanks so much Sol xxxxx",5,2015-06-25 12:03:00,2305,Active Cleanse,Fee,
"I have done this cleanse three times now and absolutely LOVE IT! Whenever I feel low energy, sluggish, or have that 3pm crash, I sign up for an Active cleanse. Honestly, if it was possible, i’d have that lemon cayenne pepper drink delivered every morning- such an INCREDIBLE start to the day! I feel the results immediately. I’m obsessed. Delivery was quick and easy, and I have found it to be brilliant value for money. The little tea dipping thing that comes with the pack I still use everyday. The warm soup cleanse I did in winter because I didn’t fancy anything cold, and found that to be brilliant in stopping the bad eating habits that come with being a mother of three (and snacking all day on random kid scraps because I’m too knackered to actually cook myself a meal!). I think what the girls are doing is brilliant and I highly recommend it from start to finish. xoxo",5,2018-10-13 19:08:12,2305,Active Cleanse,Claire Alexander-Johnston,clairealexa@gmail.com

I am a very active person who eats a substantial amount of food and found the 5 day active cleanse that I did was probably too long for me, by day 4-5 I found my energy levels really plummeted which I feel was from lack of food rather than ‘toxins being released’.

I lead an active lifestyle and run a very busy business so this suited me perfectly. I had the salad for dinner and the nut milk just before bed and I went to sleep feeling content and satisfied. I literally feel I could continue for another 5 days! I did have some organic miso soup a couple of times in the first couple of days while I acclimatised to the cleanse but by day three I did not need it anymore.

"This cleanse was amazing! The juices and broth tasted great. There was lots of info that helped along the way. I will definitely be doing this again and can highly recommend it. I've done 2 other juices cleanses prior to this one, but I did them on my own. This is much easier and convenient than having to buy and prepare your own. It's worth the money and I'm feeling amazing post cleanse. Thanks so much Sol Cleanse!",5,2020-02-17 09:58:05,2378,Custom Cleanse,Brooke,hello@tweedcoastscoop.com.au
"This is my favourite cleanse; this is my third time doing it and I LOVE it so much. The juices are so delicious, it doesn't feel like you're missing out on anything as I am always looking forward to my next juice. I custom mine so I can finish the day with something warm, the broth, which is so yum and the perfect nourishing treat before bed. I could't recommend Sol Cleanse highly enough, it's all organic and so affordable, it's the perfect reboot for me when I am feeling a bit empty xx ",5,2020-03-10 08:50:07,2378,Custom Cleanse,Charlotte Barry,cbarry@starlight.org.au

I felt the affects of the cleanse after one day! I felt lighter and more energetic. This continued on until the cleanse finished. I wasnt hungry. I had enough juice and broth to fill me up. I was still able to work and exercise. I didnt have any cravings (but i did want to chew something!). My sluggish bowel improved. The best feeling was feeling so much lighter and less achey.

"This is my second cleanse. I enjoyed choosing my options this time around. Everything about this cleanse was perfect - the delicious juices, the lovely emails, the support, the communication, the Facebook group community, the labels on the lids of the jars, the cleanse pack... 

I’m on my last day of the 5 day custom cleanse and have really enjoyed it. I probably should have prepped a few days before the cleanse but I managed quite well. The be light tea was quite nice this time around and I look forward to enjoying more herbal teas from here on in. 
I have lost 3 kgs but I didn’t do this to lose weight. I really wanted to get back on track with healthy eating and felt that this was what I needed. I feel fantastic. I don’t have any cravings, no bloating and I feel lighter and have more energy and concentration. I have also been sleeping quite well. I did have a headache at the end of day one and quite bad on day 2 but day 3, 4 and today I have been feeling great. 

I really love the names of all the juices. When asked what I’m having I just say “Love” or “Peace”, it makes me enjoy it so much more. Chosen options - Energise, Prana, Wandering, Love, Wisdom, Peace.

If you have ‘Peace’ as one of your juices/options and you like the flavour of nut milks you will love this. I drink this as my before bed drink. It’s the perfect end to the day with a little sweetness. I also did this last year. Peace is my favourite.

I have just finished the book ‘The Eat Right Diet’ during the cleanse and am now looking at eating for my blood type, which will be an easy transition from the cleanse for me personally so thank you Sol Cleanse.

I would definitely recommend these cleanses to anyone that really needs a kickstart in getting healthy or just to feel healthier in general. 

And just to add to this. I love the jars that these juices come in. I have reused them for so many things now as this is my second cleanse in 12 months. I have ‘Sol Cleanse’ jars everywhere.
- I punched a hole in a few lids and attached to the jars with some ribbon and placed some flowers in. I gave a jar with a special ‘word’ (peace, love, joy, etc) on them for both of my Mother’s and a few other ladies who really needed them on Mother’s Day
- I keep my fresh herbs in the fridge or dried herbs in the pantry
- I store my freshly picked rosemary sticks for lamb/vegetable kebabs for the following day
- I keep my be light tea in reusable tea bags in a jar
- I store my fresh made juices/smoothies for the following day
- make overnight oats
- use for gifts
- if you can’t use them donate them as there is always someone looking for jars

Thanks Sol Cleanse once again. I look forward to my next cleanse.",5,2020-05-19 21:37:43,2378,Custom Cleanse,Kate Wilkinson,katewilkinson2012@gmail.com

"This is the second 3 day cleanse I have done. The second time around was more successful and I seemed to have been in a better frame of mind. Successful because I was able to select my prefered juices (which were 4 out of 6 and were really yum) and structured times of when to take these. My first experience I was easily exhausted and could not wait to eat once the cleanse was complete. Second experience I felt more in tune with my body, however this was achieved through additional practices (colonic hydrotherapy pre-cleanse, sauna & float on day 3 of cleanse). The combination has been a worthwhile investment to achieve my overall goal of a nutritonal reset. I very much recommend the 3 day cleanse and I plan to keep this a regular practice.",5,2021-10-10 17:43:20,2378,Custom Cleanse,Anita,anitacook.burgess@gmail.com

"I undertook the 3 day Broths and Greens. With trepidation I opened my first Jar, ""Energise"" to my great relief it tasted amazing, mental hurdle over and I was hooked. I thought I would be hungry, however, I struggled to finish all of the delicious little jars occupying the ""Top Shelf"" in the fridge. On completion, I feel far more conscious of what I choose to indulge in, I feel lighter in the stomach, less sluggish and quite energetic.

"I was so excited when I received my juice delivery. I guess I didn’t realised how hard core the cleanse I had ordered was (please don’t restrict your cleanse quiz to people who submit their email address). Day 1 was very hard. I had a caffeine headache for 4 hours but I knew it was something I had to just deal with.  Initially I did not love one of the juices (Balance) yet now, a week later I find myself craving it.  I adored the Prana broth and Energise elixir and have since been making wit each morning post my cleanse. All in all I felt amazing by day 3. While not recommended, I did have an apple and a piece of toast with an evening soup (I had accidentally thought I could only have 5 juices a day instead of 6). Nonetheless I lost an incredible amount of weight but more importantly, it reset my appetite and metabolism. I am planning on doing another round of cleansing soon and am in the market for a juicer! I am so glad I did this cleanse- it has triggered a real mind shift for me and I am delighted. Exactly what I neeeded.

"My daughter and I did the Broth and Green cleanse together.
We rang each other every day to check in to see how we were going.We had very different experiences which was perfect.
We did both want to see what would come up emotionally when we cleansed as we both have done cleanses before we know once the food clears often dormant emotions surface.
The first day was faring easy and did yoga and a lot of self care,by the evening I was start to feel hungry and was struggling but I just kept really hydrated and kept sipping my lovely tea.
Woke up on the second day felt good but this was definitely my hardest day and I was back at work.
The third day I woke and felt amazing,I Felt almost euphoric,my skin was glowing and so was I !
Interesting emotionally I had bit of a incident at work and through this I found my voice to stand up peacefully but with integrity and Strength.
I truly believe layers of me were been shed.
That afternoon I cleaned my house again it felt like I was making room for the new to come in.
I didn’t rush to have food the next morning I felt so grounded and presence.
When I did have my porridge I couldn’t eat it all!!
The juices and broth as so delicious and nourishing the miso is the best I’ve ever tasted!
It’s all mind over matter.
A wonderful experience which I will definitely be making a consistent part of my Life.

"I had a wonderful experience on the three-day broth and greens cleanse! I was super excited when my package came with everything I needed in the box. The hardest part was the two days in the lead-up to the cleanse when I was detoxing off coffee, but I would 100% recommend doing this as it makes the first day of the cleanse MUCH easier. The juices and broths were delicious and provided variety, and the tea, husks and probiotics were the perfect support for my digestion. I would also recommend meditating/resting/doing yoga/journalling, as this reminds you of why you're doing it - for your body! I also loved the little email encouragement each day, it was just what I needed when I woke up as I did the cleanse alone. It was soo exciting to start eating again and now I am craving healthy, yummy, nutritious food that my body needs. I would definitely do this again when I need another reset. Thank you Sol!

I had a question during the cleanse that was quickly answered by the in house nutritionist. My girlfriend and I cleansed together and both had comments from people asking what we had been doing differently as they said we were “glowing.”  Loved doing it with the change of season and can for sure see this becoming a regular part of my seasonal shifts.

Loved all the juices and makes being healthy easy and fun. Love the convenience.  I have been daily juicing for about 15 years but having the prepared juices gives me a break. Thanks for a great product. One more thing I would say to others ordering is that Sol juices are organic as opposed to other companies using products that have been sprayed. Sprayed produce for me is not an option. So thanks for going organic. ,5,2018-08-31 15:21:49,2514,Custom Juice Pack,Lisa P.,soullevelhealing@gmail.com

"I can’t highly recommend Sol Cleanse enough. I wanted to start the year off on a healthy start. The organic plant nutrition and wellness inspired juices are delicious. Made on the day and delivered in a cold pack. And there is also place’s were you can order them on line and go pick them up the next day. I have been having them now for three weeks. I have so much more energy and my Digestive system is working so much better. They honestly taste delicious, and that’s coming from someone who didn’t like juices, fruit or vegetables. The staff are wonderful, always there to answer any questions, so helpful. And if you email, they reply within a couple of hours.

I have done 2 cleanses.  
But I particularly love being able to pick my own juices and being able to add that extra little boost of goodness to my diet.
And the Custom Juice Pack is my go to, both in Winter and Summer for a yummy vitamin boost.  Love the pineapple, and can't wait for Watermelon to come, to mix in with my Green Juices.

I love everything about this, from the awesome service, the packaging, the tea, the motivational emails, the juices and the more substantial kale salad and lentil dish. I feel lighter and inspired to create healthier dishes in my own kitchen.

"I’ve done juice cleanse before and always found 1 or 2 juices in your day that weren’t great. This is different. Every juice is delicious and the whole foods cleanse includes a great salad for lunch which I’m still craving for.
I was drinking pretty much everyday thanks to covid and this has been a great way to press the stop button and restart. My mind is clear and I’ve never slept so well!
I did the 5 day. Day 2 was tough but I just took it easy. The rest of the days I maintained my exercise whether that be a gentle jog or some weights (lighter than usual).

"Overall it was a great experience. On day 1 it was exciting and fun. Day 2-4 I felt extremely drained with severe headaches and wasn’t focussing well at my job. It wasn’t because the hunger as there was plenty of juices, it was the lack of sustained energy over a busy day.
If anyone is looking to do this while working their physical job - don’t. Take a week to rest and go through the process properly. I woke up on day 5 feeling fantastic and have gone into the weekend extremely grateful for the process . It was quite pricey for a weeks worth of food in comparison but for a treat every now and then I can see the value. My advice is definitely around the self love and rest aspect of a cleanse. It’s not something you can have running alongside your normal day to day life. Ps. Green juices are AMAZING ",4,2020-10-19 05:46:04,11757,Wholefoods Cleanse,Anonymous,gemma_tamra@hotmail.com

"This was my second time cleansing with Sol Cleanse, first time doing the warrior cleanse. I was surprised at how nourishing it was in comparison to a juice cleanse. I did a work out, played sport and went to work during the 3 days and never felt as though my energy levels were too low to do any of these. The lunch and dinners were tasty and I felt satiated after each, but having the snacks and juices to top up were great. My only issue was the headache from going cold turkey on coffee - if anything I would ween off it before the cleanse but the tea helped ease the cravings a little. Overall, loved it and I feel like I gave my body the reset it needed.",5,2021-03-18 11:54:53,35842,Warrior Cleanse,Casey,caseyhamilton02@gmail.com
"Really enjoyed doing this Warrior cleanse. Came at the perfect time, as I wanted to do a juice cleanse but didn’t have the time to set aside for saving my energy to invest in it right now. Was able to easily keep my normal routine, as I like to keep very active. Routine usually involves surfing, gym, yoga, hot and cold plunges and a fairly physical job. Insight was a great meal to have midday as it provided me with the energy I needed to get through the rest of the afternoon and to my activities, then adding radiant and the snack included was even better. Having the larger sizes made it seem less daunting and more motivating to push through and complete it. Plus mixing the protein with my peace+ in the morning made it an even more delicious meal to keep me feeling full. Loved it and gave me the healthy and organic kick I needed right now. Thanks Sol Cleanse!",5,2021-03-18 17:57:16,35842,Warrior Cleanse,Jacob,jmajo21@hotmail.com
"I have done a handful of Sol Cleanses and this one I felt the most energy from. I found that I had no hunger pains as the main meals really fill up the bowl and taste quite nice.  My routine felt to be the same without any lag and I noticed I had a clearer mind at the end. I found the chocolate protein powder to be an amazing addition to the breakfast smoothie, didn't really feel i liked it or needed it by itself throughout the day with water of milk. 
I would like to think I can make this cleanse habitual, perhaps monthly or 6 weekly. I wonder if Sol Cleanse do a subscription offer?",5,2021-03-22 09:43:35,35842,Warrior Cleanse,Dan,dan_wray@hotmail.com

"Absolutely loved the Sol Warrior Cleanse. I was able to continue with my everyday life with the energy I needed. The juices and Dahls were delicious, and after the first day, I felt amazing. This will be something that I continue to do on a regular basis.  ",5,2021-06-09 10:52:20,35842,Warrior Cleanse,Anonymous,katarina.coombes@gmail.com
An amazing cleanse to do while still being active. It replenishes you when you need it but still keeps things light.,5,2021-08-18 12:44:35,35842,Warrior Cleanse,alanah v.,alanah.viall@hotmail.com
